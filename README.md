# housing_price_prediction 
This repo contains a notebook that uses Apache Spark to create and evaluate models to determine the housing price from
data hosted on Kaggle. It uses regression models, and PCA Dimension Reduction techniques to determine the best model. 
The DecisionTreeRegressor,RandomForestRegressor, and IsotonicRegression are used to create models.
